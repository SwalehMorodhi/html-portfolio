<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello! What's going on?</h2>
<p>I'm Swaleh Morodhi, a civil engineer who also studies web development and who combines site work with coding to better himself.</p>

<h3>Engineering is what I live for</h3>
<p>But during the day when I'm not on-site or coding. I'm either working out at the gym or viewing the newest flicks at home. I'm attempting to develop a new habit in order to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Currently, I am an Intern at KURA and a student learning Web Development with my tutor Angela Yu on Udemy.</p>
